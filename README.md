# Custom Slate Editor 
A Component Library Template repository. This is a solution for an issue in [Slate.js](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate) that it does not support multiple document schemas. Hence we create a package for each editor instead.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` - To start the development server and develop the editor.
- `npm run build` - To update the distribution files after the development of the editor.
